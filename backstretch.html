                   <h4>Research &amp; Discovery</h4>
                    <p>I began by diving deep into Backstretch.biz’s brand identity and target audience. Their keywords—Empower, Transform, Success, Partnership, Fun, Stress-Free, Nimble, Journey, Trusted, Strategic Advantage, Exceptional Talent, Build Together, 
                        Innovation, Energy, Abstract, Focus—guided the design narrative. <br><br>I sourced imagery that embodied these themes: abstract visuals representing innovation, energetic team collaborations, 
                        and clean, focused designs with an emphasis on the linear road to convey professionalism and the idea of a journey.<br><br>

                        <p>Using a mobile-first approach, I developed the landing page with responsive design principles to ensure seamless functionality across devices. 
                            The design was brought to life with smooth animations and interactive elements to enhance user engagement.<br><br>

                            generation within the first month. The strategic use of keywords and imagery helped improve their SEO ranking, making the page a powerful tool for
